# 👋 Hi, I'm Uzonna

I'm a software developer with a focus on building fullstack web applications using modern, production-ready technologies.

I recently completed a fullstack Job Tracker platform that features authentication, advanced filtering, dashboards, CI/CD pipelines, and a fully Dockerized environment — designed to reflect real-world dev team workflows. I'm passionate about clean, testable code, and I’m actively pursuing opportunities in development and QA where I can contribute to meaningful products.
